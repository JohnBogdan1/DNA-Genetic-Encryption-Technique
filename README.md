# DNA-Genetic-Encryption-Technique

Implemented a DNA encryption algorithm based on symmetric key encryption combined with a genetic algorithm.
It is based on this paper: Hamdy M. Mousa,"DNA-Genetic Encryption Technique", International Journal of Computer
Network and Information Security(IJCNIS), Vol.8, No.7, pp.1-9, 2016.DOI: 10.5815/ijcnis.2016.07.01.

#### Update

- Added the decryption
- Added script to run encryption + decryption
- Added utils file where I added the methods and variables used in both operations
- Updated the encryption to write the decription key string (i.e. key + {number of rounds, the random values used in reshape, crossover, mutation}) to a file
- Adjusted the reshape method to work as intended.
